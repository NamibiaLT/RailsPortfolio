# Namibia Torres's Developer Portfolio

_This Web Portfolio was created so that I could both update my existing portfolio with the work I have been doing, and work on strengthening my skills in Rails_

### <u> About Me: </u>

* I am a self taught developer, who is a career changer with a Nutrition Science, Statistics, and Research Background
* I currently work for an amazing software company as a Software Engineer, and I am not looking for work. I love my company and I love what I do.
